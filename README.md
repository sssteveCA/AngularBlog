About
This is a web app in Angular that simulates a blog. 
It's a beta version and not fully completed yet.
It uses PHP and MySql to allows users to login and subscribe to the blog.
There are some Typescript and PHP constants that can be edited to work in different situations.
To work properly it requires jQuery and Bootstrap npm modules installed.
