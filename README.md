This is a web app in Angular that simulates a blog.<br>
It's a beta version and not fully completed yet.<br>
It uses PHP and MySql to allows users to login and subscribe to the blog.<br>
There are some Typescript and PHP constants that can be edited to work in different situations.<br>
To work properly it requires jQuery and Bootstrap npm modules installed.<br>
